# Getting Started

## Learning as I go

heres a bunch of commands i ran.

    npm i webpack -S
    npm i babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react -S
    npm i react react-dom -S


This appears to make things rebuild automatically

    ./node_modules/.bin/webpack -d --watch


You should open src/client/index.html in a browser and bask in the glory.
